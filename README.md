Bluetooth_Controlled_Robotic_vehicle_using_STM32

This is a remote-controlled Bluetooth car project using an STM32G431RB microcontroller instead of an Arduino UNO. The car is controlled via a mobile application connected through a Bluetooth (HC-06 module). The project originally simulated the implementation before proceeding to final hardware installation.

Features & Functionalities:

This car is controlled using mobile application.
The car can go forward, backward, turn left and turn right.
We can stop this car using break button form mobile app.
Can rotate 360 degree
